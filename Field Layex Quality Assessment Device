Natural rubber latex is the tree sap collected from h.brasillienssis. It is a poly isoprene organic compound and consists of around 55 to 65 percent water and 30 to 40 percent of rubber material and sugar, resin, protein and ash etc. As latex is mostly collected by small & marginal farmers, the chances of contamination is very high with latex. The contaminated latex drastically effect in further processing of sheet rubber. By developing IoT system for the checking of contamination of field latex at farmers level can improve in production of high grade sheet rubber.The data collected by IoT device can be transformed into an AI generated digital certificate of the Latex quality will increase the acceptability of the field latex.
